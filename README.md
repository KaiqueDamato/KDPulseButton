# Demo

# Usage
There are a few properties you may change:

* **pulseColor** : the color of the pulse
* **pulseDuration** : the duration of the pulse animation in seconds
* **cornerRadius** : the radius of the button view
* **buttonColor** : the color of the button

All properties are ***IBInspectable*** so you can just drag and drop a new button, change the class and make all the configurations that you need in the Storyboard.

I wish you a funny and happy coding. ðŸ¤“ðŸš€
